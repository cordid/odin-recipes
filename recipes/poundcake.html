    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This homemade pound cake recipe is buttery and rich with the flavor of
      shortbread cookies but still tender and light as a feather.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>3 ¼ cups white sugar</li>
      <li>¾ pound unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
      <li>6 extra large eggs, at room temperature</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract</li>
      <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon baking powder</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
      <li>1 cup 1% milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a
        12-cup fluted tube pan (such as Bundt).
      </li>
      <li>
        Cream sugar and butter in a large mixing bowl on medium speed until
        light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, beating for
        45 seconds after each addition. Add vanilla extract and beat for 30
        seconds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine flour, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg in a medium bowl. Add 1/2
        of the flour mixture to the butter mixture and mix on low speed until
        just blended. Add 1/2 cup milk and beat on low speed until just blended.
        Scrape the sides of the bowl with a spatula between each addition.
        Repeat with remaining flour mixture and milk.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour batter into the prepared baking pan, filling no more than 2/3 full.
        Smooth the top with a spoon or a spatula.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center
        comes out clean and the cake is just starting to pull away from the
        sides of the pan, about 1 hour and 25 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the oven and allow to cool for about 15 minutes before
        inverting onto a plate. Allow to cool completely before serving.
      </li>
    </ol>
